            Emulating A CPU With C++ 
        </h1>
        <p>
            The following is a brief explanation  on how to emulate a CPU using C++. Please note that this is a general procedure,
             and will change depending on what CPU you are planning on emulating. CPU<sub>1</sub> will require different
             specifications from CPU<sub>2</sub>, so please read the data sheet for your specific CPU, and don't just blindly follow along.
             For this explanation , we are emulating a <wbr> 6502 8-bit processor.

            Key Terms
        </h2>
        <p>
            Before we can begin emulating, we need to know key terms:
        </p>
        <p>
            <!--*5-->
            <mark><ins><dfn><abbr title="Central Processing Unit">
               CPU:
            </abbr></dfn></ins></mark>
             The component of a computer system that performs the basic operations (such as processing data) of the system, 
            that exchanges data with the system's memory or peripherals, and that manages the system's other components. <sup>1</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            <mark><ins><dfn>Computer Register:</dfn></ins></mark>
            A processor register is a quickly accessible location available to a computer's processor.
            Registers usually consist of a small amount of fast storage, although some registers have specific hardware functions, 
            and may be read-only or write-only. <sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            <!--*5-->
            <!--*6-->
            <mark><ins><dfn><abbr title="Program Counter">
                PC:
             </abbr></dfn></ins></mark>
            A special register in the CPU. The PC is incremented after fetching an instruction, 
            and holds the memory address of ("points to") the next instruction that would be executed.<sup>3</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            <mark><ins><dfn><abbr title="Stack Counter">
                <!--*5-->
                SC:
             </abbr></dfn></ins></mark>
            A stack pointer is a small register that stores the memory address of the last data element added to the stack or, in some cases, 
            the first available address in the stack.<sup>5</sup>
        </p>

        <h2>Code Exploration</h2><!--*1-->
        <p>
            Now that we know the key terms, we can begin exploring the code needed to emulate the <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>. <strong>Please note: </strong>
            This  program is not complete, but more of a beginner template. I will try to explain the program as thoroughly as possible,
              but for more information please reach out. I am available anyday <del>before <time datetime="12:00">noon</time></del> after
               <time datetime="16:00">4:00pm</time> <small>est</small>.
        </p>
        <h4><!--*1-->
            Section 1, inclusions
        </h4>
        <code>
            #include &ltstdio.h&gt
            <br>
            #include &ltstdlib.h&gt   
        </code>
        <br>
        <p>
            <!--*4-->
            The code above are simple include statements. As the book <cite>Introduction to C++ Programming</cite> states, these statements <q>link external libraries to our program, 
                allowing us to use useful functions.</q> <sup>4</sup> If you are unaware of include statements, 
                I recommend you review C++ before continuing.
        </p>
        <h4><!--*1-->
            Section 2, defining data types
        </h4>
        <pre>
            <code> <!--*2-->   
                //8 bits
                using Byte = unsigned char;
                //16 bit
                using Word = unsigned short;
                //32 bit
                using u32 = unsigned int;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            The code above redefines data types that we will be using most often. For our purposes we need an 8-bit data type, a 16-bit data type,
            and a 32-bit data type. We can use the <code>using</code> keyword to rename datatypes already included in C++ to make programming 
            easier for us. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For those of you unfamiliar with the <code>using</code> keyword, it is similar to typedef. Both allow the programmer to rename 
            data types. However, <strong>please note</strong>, typedef has depreciated and you should no longer use it in your programs.
        </p>
        <h4><!--*1-->
            Section 3, emulating the memory
        </h4>
        <pre>
            <code><!--*2-->   
            struct Mem{
                static constexpr u32 MAX_MEM = 1024 * 64;
                Byte Data[MAX_MEM];
                void Initialize(){
                    for (u32 i; i < MAX_MEM; ++i){
                        //Set all of the memory to 0
                        Data[i] = 0;
                    }
                }
                
                //Read Byte from memory
                Byte operator[](u32 Address) const{
                    return Data[Address];
                }
                
                //Write Byte to memory
                Byte &operator[](u32 Address){
                    return Data[Address];
                }
            };
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            <!--*5-->
            This portion of code simulates our memory available to our <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> and simulates how our memory would work. The first two lines are variables that define the space in our memory. 
            For this chip, there are 1024 &times 64 possible memory locations. <q>Data</q> represents our physical memory, and when we use the <q>Initialize</q>
            function, we set each position of our memory to 0.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next two code blocks are operator overloads. Operator overloads redefines how the language uses operators. For these two cases,
            the operator overload allows the programmer to return an <q>address</q> from our <q>memory</q>. For example, if the user passes <q>32</q> to the second 
            operator overload function, it will return the 32nd index of memory, allowing that memory location to be overwritten.
        </p>

            		return Data;
            	}
            
            	void Execute(u32 Cycles, Mem &mem){
            		while (Cycles > 0){
            			//CPU functions would go here
            		}
            	}
            };

        <p>
            <!--*5-->
            <strong><em>Finally</em></strong>, now that we have our libraries included, data types defined, and memory established we can 
            start emulating our <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>. This may seem daunting, 
            but it is actually just elementary C++ code. The first 16 lines are variables establishing our <abbr title="Program Counter">PC</abbr>, 
            <abbr title="Stack Counter">SC</abbr>, registers and flags. These variables will all be used later in our code.
        </p>
        <p>
            <!--*5-->
            The first function in our <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> struct sets all of the pointers to their starting locations in memory, and 
            setting all of the flags and registers to 0. This function also calls the <q>Initialize</q> function in the mem struct to set
            all of the values in the memory to 0.
            <!--*3-->
            For example: <abbr title="Program Counter">PC</abbr> is set to memory address 0xFFFC. Since we input 0xFFFC, the output is a variable
            which <q>points to</q> memory address 0xFFFC, or the first location of memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next two functions are similar, but differ in one important way. The first function, <q>FetchByte</q> gets the memory address
            the program counter is pointing to, increments the program counter, then decrements the number of  cycles. <Strong>Please Note:</Strong>
            To access the memory address we are using the operator we overloaded in the Memory struct, tying everything back together.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The other function <q>ReadByte</q> also gets the value of the memory, but instead of getting the value the program counter is pointing to,
            <q>ReadByte</q> gets the value of memory that we ask it to get, and does not increment the program counter. Otherwise, it is 
            the same as <q>FetchByte</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally we have the <q>Execute</q> function. This function does as you would expect, it calls a function that the CPU would execute, and 
            keeps executing while it has enough cycles to do so.
